There are various directions and methods to build a prototype, including digital and non-digital practices.

There's also a collection of different digital tools that can all be helpful for creating your levels. In the following though, we would like to introduce an example by Alex K. of level prototyping that uses both non-digital and digital methods to guide you through the whole process and all the various iterations of the steps.
